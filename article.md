**This is a practical how-to guide on using synthetic users and AI automation to support your design process. The goal is simple: help you improve your workflow, accelerate your iteration cycles, and strengthen your outcomes by integrating AI as a reliable teammate throughout your daily work.**

Design work depends on something we rarely have enough of: **timely, high-quality feedback.** Most teams wait for the next design share or PM sync or user session, hoping for clarity but often getting surface-level reactions or not enough time to explore the idea. The cycle slows down. Early concepts feel uncertain. A lot of manual effort goes into preparing work that still doesn’t get the depth of critique it needs.

AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot are beginning to change this dynamic. They can function as synthetic teammates across the roles we typically rely on. You can work with them as designers, PMs, architects, researchers, or even as customers seeing your idea for the first time. They provide fast, repeatable feedback whenever you need it. They help you explore the problem space, improve your reasoning, and reduce the overhead required to get to a strong concept.


This article is a practical guide to using AI to accelerate design and research. The focus is on the everyday tasks that slow us down and the ways synthetic users can ease that load. You will learn how to build a small roster of AI teammates, how to tune each one so it reflects the perspective you need, and how to integrate them into your workflow so iteration becomes faster and more confident.

  

**Let’s start with why this shift matters to designers.**

---  

Before we get too far, I can already hear the little voices from other designers in the room: 

*“But Neil, isn’t this cheating?”* or *“AI doesn’t give us completely accurate results,”* or *“Isn’t this going to displace us?”* So let’s address those quickly. 

- No, it’s not cheating. You’re simply using the tools available to you, just like autocorrect or a quick Wikipedia search. It’s smart, not dishonest. 
- And yes, AI can be imperfect, but accuracy isn’t the point. If it offloads even half the manual work, that’s still a meaningful amount of time saved. You will always validate the output. You stay in control. 
- Think of it as a time saver, not an autonomous decision-maker. And no, this doesn’t displace designers. It creates a shift-left advantage. You get to spend more time earlier in the project where the thinking is most valuable, where customer experience gets shaped, and where your craft has the most influence.

The opportunity space for design is in a "shift-left" mindset where we can most effectively work with their product partners to maximize the value of their skills and experiences.


## Accelerating design through synthetic pair teammates

  

Design moves fastest when feedback is close to the work. The challenge isn’t capability or creativity. It’s the rhythm of modern product teams. You know the drill. You get a 15 min slot in either your design team meeting or your 3IAB product team meeting. You prepare your material, explain your idea, and you get either crickets, or feedback on details that aren't targeted at the actual product design. Large meetings limit critique feedback even more. Time slots run out, people run over their allotted time. You get the point. The dialogue often stays at the surface because the room is too big for deep engagement.

  

In between those touchpoints, designers spend considerable time gathering context: market scans, competitive audits, rewriting highly technical stories into a format designers can act on, and organizing the content that will eventually shape the experience.

  

Synthetic users tighten that loop. They give you instant access to multiple perspectives at the exact moment you need them. You can ask questions, refine flows, pressure-test assumptions, and clarify intent without waiting for a meeting or preparing a deck. The feedback cadence aligns with your design cadence.

Feedback doesn’t need to replicate a full design share to be useful. It just needs to be available, honest, and repeatable. Synthetic users provide a controlled environment where you can work through ideas at the speed you’re thinking.

  

**Faster cycles enhances understanding and gains clarity sooner**

# What are synthetic users?

  

Synthetic users are AI-driven teammates you design with intention and purpose. They exist for a specific purpose: to give you reliable feedback exactly when you need it. They aren’t shortcuts and they aren’t gimmicks. They’re tools available right now that can help reduce manual toil and accelerate understanding.

  

They’re built as extensions of the personalities you rely on every day: designers, product managers, technical architects, researchers, customers, and executive stakeholders. Each brings a unique lens to the work and helps you explore ideas from angles that normally take days or weeks to access.

  

You define the role, the skill focus, the experience, the temperament, and even the style of feedback you want — whether it should be short and direct or more descriptive and exploratory. A designer who leans toward UI craft might focus on how a screen reads and how information is grouped. A systems-oriented designer might challenge the structure, the end-to-end flow, or the narrative logic. A PM anchors the work to the problem. An architect grounds it in feasibility. A customer reacts as if seeing it for the first time.

  

The real value is the range and flexibility. You can switch perspectives instantly and run multiple critique loops throughout the day. You can take a raw idea, cycle it through several synthetic teammates, refine it, and return with a sharper version long before you share it with your team.

# What core personas you should create

  

Here are some of my go-to profiles.

  

A solid synthetic roster should mimic the team of people who already support your work. The goal isn’t to recreate individuals but to capture the perspectives you need to shape, test, iterate, and refine ideas from multiple angles. Think of this as a small virtual design organization that you have instant access to.

  

Start with the roles that consistently influence product decisions.

### Designers with different lenses

You may want a range of design perspectives based on skill and experience. Some personas focus on UI-level clarity. Others think at the system level and challenge whether the flow holds together end-to-end. Both catch different things and both are valuable.

Example variants of the designer:
- Designer 
- Sr designer
- Principal designer
- Each can have a specialty like UX, visual, product or service design

  

### Product managers

PM personas help keep the solution anchored to the problem and business context. They help you assess whether your solution aligns with the requirements and what the business truly needs. A second PM persona — one less attached to the project — gives a more objective reading without internal anchoring.

  

### Technical architects

Architect personas ground the design in feasibility. They raise implementation risks early, challenge overly complex patterns, and point out steps that might fail once real systems or enterprise-scale conditions apply.

  

### Customer profiles

Customer personas simulate how real users might encounter your idea for the first time. You can tune these personas to SREs, DevOps engineers, network operators, IT admins, and more. They reveal what resonates, what confuses, and what feels misaligned.

  

### Researchers and analysts

Synthetic researchers help sweep the industry for patterns, terminology, workflows, and competitive examples. When paired with synthetic analysts, they help you understand market context, growth trends, value angles, and positioning opportunities.

  

### Executive stakeholders

These personas help you rehearse strategic conversations before they happen. A VP of design evaluates experience quality. A VP of product looks for alignment and differentiation. A CTO challenges innovation, feasibility, and long-term strategy. They help you sharpen your narrative before you ever present to real leadership.

# Define, store, and reuse your synthetic team

  

Once you know the personas you want, define them in a way that makes them consistent, reusable, and easy to tune. Treat synthetic users like any other design asset. They should be structured, editable, and stored somewhere reliable.

  

Each persona should include:

  

- Role and purpose

- Skills and domain experience

- Feedback style (short, direct, descriptive, critical, structural, business-focused, technical)

- Personality traits that shape tone and response

# Store and reuse them like any other design asset

  

Markdown is the ideal format for synthetic users. It’s clean, readable, and works across nearly every AI tool. It’s easy to version, simple to edit, portable across teams, and fits naturally into GitOps workflows.

  

Store your personas in a safe, reliable place. GitHub is perfect because it provides version control, history, forks, and the ability to refine profiles over time — just like components in a design system.

  

Your synthetic team should evolve. You’ll tune parameters, adjust traits, and refine behaviors as you learn what kind of feedback is most useful.

# Use them as part of your daily workflow

  

Once defined, synthetic users become part of your daily rhythm. You can:

  

- Attach a persona to any prompt

- Ask for critique from a specific perspective

- Chain personas together for layered feedback

- Build content inventories

- Refine flows or narratives

- Break down requirements

- or simply think out loud with a consistent voice

  

**Synthetic users become powerful once they’re a reusable part of your process, not a one-off experiment**

# How to use your synthetic users throughout your design process

  

Synthetic users fit into almost every stage of design. You can use them to understand a problem, explore structure, refine flows, prepare for research, or rehearse for leadership reviews. They give you more cycles of thinking without waiting for anyone’s calendar.

  

### Understanding a new story

Use synthetic PMs and researchers to rewrite or unpack requirements, reveal assumptions, and identify missing context.

  

### Early exploration and ideation

Use design personas to explore narratives, flows, alternatives, risks, and opportunities.

  

### Building content inventories

Use content strategists and researchers to define what information matters and how users expect it to be grouped.

  

### Rapid critique loops

Run your low-fidelity ideas through designers, PMs, architects, and customers. Refine and repeat.

  

### Preparing for real user research

Use synthetic researchers to plan studies, define signals, and later summarize transcripts.

  

### Preparing for stakeholders

Use executive personas to rehearse narratives, challenge assumptions, and strengthen your argument.

  

**Synthetic users give you more clarity and stronger thinking long before anyone else sees the work**

# A realistic workflow example

  

Imagine a PM asks you to improve incident remediation for SREs.

  

1. You start by using synthetic PMs and researchers to rewrite the story, clarify assumptions, and fill knowledge gaps.

2. You run an industry sweep for terminology, workflows, and competitive patterns.

3. You generate a content inventory using a synthetic strategist.

4. You explore narratives, alternative flows, and structural variations using design personas.

5. You sketch low-fidelity flows and run them through designers, PMs, architects, and customers.

6. You prepare for user research with synthetic researchers, then later summarize transcripts with them.

7. You rehearse for leadership with synthetic executives to sharpen your story.

# Why this matters and how to get started

  

Design depends on iteration, reflection, and perspective. The bottleneck has always been time between cycles and the manual effort required for each one.

  

Synthetic users help remove that friction. They give you more cycles, more perspectives, and more clarity early in the process — when it matters most.

  

To get started:

  

1. Create a small roster of synthetic teammates.

2. Define their purpose and feedback style.

3. Store them in Markdown.

4. Pull them into your workflow daily.

5. Refine them as you learn.

*Combine any of these with automation tools like n8n ( which we'll cover in a later story ), and you have a pipeline of innovation that will unleash your creativity, enabling you to focus on innovation, and less on manual effort*

**Synthetic users don’t replace collaboration — they amplify your ability to think, explore, and prepare**
